## Data Structures

### 1. Linked List

![Linked List](images/linked_list.png)

Description: Linked list is a linear data structure where elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element points to the next element, forming a chain-like structure.

### 2. Stack

![Stack](images/stack.png)

Description: Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top.

### 3. Queue

![Queue](images/queue.png)

Description: Queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added from the rear end and removed from the front end.

## Algorithms

### 1. Sorting Algorithms

![Sorting Algorithms](images/sorting_algorithms.png)

Description: Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange elements in a specific order. Common sorting algorithms include Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

### 2. Searching Algorithms

![Searching Algorithms](images/searching_algorithms.png)

Description: Searching algorithms are used to find the location of a target value within a collection of elements. Common searching algorithms include Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.

## Object-Oriented Programming

### 1. Classes and Objects

![Classes and Objects](images/classes_and_objects.png)

Description: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code. Classes are blueprints for creating objects.

### 2. Inheritance

![Inheritance](images/inheritance.png)

Description: Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behavior from an existing class. It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.
