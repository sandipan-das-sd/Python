# 39. Write a program in python to print the name of first 3 students on the basis of the following condition: 
# a) Total = in between (80 â€“ 85) % the student is declared as 3rd 
# b) Total = in between (85 â€“ 90) % the student is declared as 2nd 
# c) Total = >90 %, the student is declared as 1st 
# (Take the input for 3 students and also take the inputs for 3 subjects each named as English, Bengali and Math. Calculate the percentage and print the result according to their rank.)
