This code defines an Employee class with an __init__ method that takes a name and a salary as arguments and assigns them to the employee object's name and salary attributes, respectively.

The fromRanita class method is an alternative way to create an Employee object from a string in the format "Name-Salary". This method splits the input string using the hyphen as a delimiter, extracts the name and salary, and uses them to create a new Employee object. The split is use to create a list.

In the code, two Employee objects are created. The first one is created using the regular __init__ method. The second one is created using the fromRanita class method, passing in a string in the format "Name-Salary". The code then prints the details of both employee objects.
