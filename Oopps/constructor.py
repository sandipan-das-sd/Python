### First Program:
# ```python
class Student:
    name="Sandipan Das"
    def __init__(self):
        print(self)
        print("Adding new student in the database... ")
   
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)
print(s1)
# ```
# - In this program, the class `Student` has a class attribute `name` set to `"Sandipan Das"`.
# - It defines an `__init__` method without any parameters.
# - When an instance of `Student` (`s1`) is created, it prints the instance's address and a message.
# - It then prints the `name` attribute of `s1`, which is `"Sandipan Das"`, and the instance's address.

### Second Program:
# ```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, fullname):
        self.name = fullname
        print("Adding new student in the database... ")
   
s1 = Student("Ranita")
print(s1.name)
s2 = Student("arjun")
print(s2.name)
# ```
# - This version of `Student` takes a `fullname` parameter in its `__init__` method and assigns it to the instance's `name` attribute.
# - When instances `s1` and `s2` are created, it prints a message indicating the addition of a new student along with the provided name.

### Third Program:
# ```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.marks = marks
        print("Adding new student in the database... ")
   
s1 = Student("Ranita", 98)
print(s1.name)
print(s1.marks)
s2 = Student("arjun", 99)
print(s2.name)
print(s2.marks)
# ```
# - Similar to the second program, but this time it takes both `name` and `marks` parameters.
# - When instances `s1` and `s2` are created, it prints a message indicating the addition of a new student along with the provided name and marks.

### Fourth Program:
# ```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
     
    def __init__(self, name, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.marks = marks
        print("Adding new student in the database... ")
   
s1 = Student("Ranita", 98)
print(s1.name)
# ```
# - This version tries to define two `__init__` methods, which is not allowed in Python.
# - Python doesn't support method overloading like some other languages.
# - Only the last `__init__` method will be considered, so the `__init__` method without parameters will not be accessible.

# In Python, if you want different behavior based on the number or type of arguments, you can use default arguments or conditional statements within a single `__init__` method.
