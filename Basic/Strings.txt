Names, values and types
------------------------
•	Values have types
•	Determine what operations are allowed
•	Names inherit type from currently assigned value
	Can assign values of different types to a name
	int, float, bool
++,-,^*,/,… and, or ,.==,!=,>,…

Manipulating text
--------------------
•	Computation is a lot more than number crunching
•	Text processing is increasingly important
•	Document preparation
•	Importing/exporting spreadsheet data
•	Matching search queries to content

Strings - type str
--------------------
•	Type string, str, a sequence of characters
•	A single character is a string of length 1
•	No separate type char
	Enclose in quotes-single, double, even triple!
city = ^' Chennai  ^'
title = "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"
dialogue = '''He said his favourite book is "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"'I'

Strings as sequences
----------------------
• String:sequence or list of characters
•Positons 0,1,2,.....,n-1 for a string of length n
  • s="hello"

    0 1 2 3 4
    h e l l 0
    -5-4-3-2-1
 • Positions -1,-2,... count backwords from end
  •s[i]=="e" ,
  s[-2]="l"  

Operations on strings
-----------------------
•Combine two strings: concatenation, operator +
	•s = "hello"
	•t=s+ ", there"
	•t is now "he1l0, there"
•len(s) returns length of s
•Will see other functions to manipulate strings later

Extracting substrings
----------------------
A slice is a "segment" of a string
	•s = "hello"
	•s[1:4] is "ell"
    •s[i:j] starts at s[i] and ends at s[j-1]
	•s[:j] starts at s[0], so s[0:j]
    •s[i:] ends at s[1en(s)-1], so s[i:1en(s)]

Modifying strings
------------------
	Cannot update a string "in place"
	•s= "hello", want to change to "help!"
	•s[3]= "p" - error!
	•Instead, use slices and concatenation
	•s=s[0:3]+"p!"
	•Strings are immutable values (more later)

Summary
---------
•	Text values - type str, sequence of characters
•	Single character is string of length 1
•	Extract individual characters by position
•	Slices extract substrings
o	glues strings together
•	Cannot update strings directly - immutable
