Sequences of values

•	Two basic ways of storing a sequence of values
    •	Arrays
    •	Lists
•	What's the difference?

Arrays
-------
•	Single block of memory, elements of uniform type
	•Typically size of sequence is fixed in advance
•	Indexing is fast
	•Access seq[i] in constant time for any i
	•Compute offset from start of memory block
•	Inserting between seq[i] and seq [i+1] is expensive
•	Contraction is expensive

Lists
-------
•	Values scattered in memory
•	Each element points to the next- "linked" list
•	Flexible size
•Follow i links to acces seq[i]
 •Cost proportional to i
